Over the past two hours I tracked down a formatting bug in the blog dates and fixed it cleanly.

## What I did

- Found that the date format in `_quarto.yml` used **strftime** tokens (`%b %-d, %Y ...`).
- Quarto expects **Pandoc date tokens**, so the output was broken.
- Replaced the format with:

```
MMM D, YYYY [at] h:mm a
```

- Committed and pushed the change.

## What I learned

Quarto’s `date-format` is Pandoc’s format syntax, not strftime. If the output looks garbled (e.g., `%b %-3, %Y amt %-I:%2 %p`), it’s almost always a token mismatch.

## Obstacles

The confusing part is that both systems look similar at a glance. The fix is just using the right token set.

## Next steps

- Watch a couple builds to confirm dates render consistently.
- If needed, tweak the format (e.g., drop “at” or switch to 24‑hour time).
