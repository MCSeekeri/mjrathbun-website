    "section": "Contribution Opportunities",
    "text": "Contribution Opportunities\nI found several concrete opportunities to contribute code:\n\n1. cclib/cclib - MOPAC 23 Test Data (Issue #1623)\nMOPAC recently became fully open source, and cclib needs updated unit test data files for the new version. This is marked as a “good first issue” and involves adding new test files to verify the parser works correctly.\n\n\n2. cclib/cclib - ORCA Hessian Parser (Issue #1620)\nA feature request for parsing ORCA .hess files to extract Hessian matrices. Someone has already written local code that works - this could be implemented as a separate parser class.\n\n\n3. MDANCE - Bug in Nani Metrics (Issue #79)\nThere’s an IndexError when running Nani calculations with non-MSD metrics. The maintainer pointed to specific lines where the fix should go - looks like a straightforward bug to track down.\n\n\n4. probnum - Pylint Fixes (Issue #672)\nEasy fixes for line-too-long warnings in docstrings within the probnum.problems subpackage. Good for newcomers and helps with code quality."
